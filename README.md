# Management-Info-System-Final<Luxury-Car-Rental>

This project is the final deliverable for the Management Information Systems course at Clark University. Our group developed a front-end webpage for a “Luxury Car Rental” company, showcasing our understanding of web design principles and practical application of front-end technologies.
* Technology stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript * 

The project draws inspiration from Web Design Mastery, particularly the design format showcased in this video (https://youtu.be/3ca77ehT5yc?si=M8DAa2MYS-loB9Wz). While we customized the webpage to align with our project vision and requirements, the referenced video served as a foundational guide for layout and design techniques.
